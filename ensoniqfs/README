1 What is EnsoniqFS?
--------------------

EnsoniqFS is a file system plugin for the file manager Total Commander created
by Christian Ghisler (http://www.ghisler.com).

With EnsoniqFS you can mount the following Ensoniq file systems:
- SCSI & IDE harddisks
- SCSI & IDE CDROMs
- floppy disk (direct file access, using driver OmniFlop, see below)
- image files (ISO only the moment, for GKH/EDE/EDA/EDT/Mode1CDROM refer to
  plugin EnsoniqUnpacker, also downloadable via SourceForge)

Once mounted, on a file system you can do the following with Total Commander:
- read, write, copy, move, rename, delete files on Ensoniq media
- copy, move files from/to Windows drives
- create, rename, copy, move whole directories

With the above, you get a complete file manager for Ensoniq disks.

This documentation needs to be extended. This will be done in the next time
in parallel with the development of EnsoniqFS.

2 Where to get it
-----------------

All the Ensoniq related stuff is located on SourceForge:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ensoniqfs/

Here you can download EnsoniqFS as and other related tools. If you're
interested, you can check out the source codes as well.

3 Installation
--------------

3.1 EnsoniqFS

To use EnsoniqFS, you first need to have Total Commander installed. Download
your copy from http://www.ghisler.com. Installation is straightforward, there
shouldn't be any problems.

Then, use Total Commander to navigate to the EnsoniqFS ZIP file you downloaded
from SourceForge. Hit <enter> on the ZIP file - Total Commander will open it
and automatically detect that it is a plugin. You're then guided through the
installation by Total Commander. It just requires a few more hits on <enter>
and your installation is finished, but make sure, that the plugin is installed
inside the Total Commander directory. If you install it to another location,
ETools will fail to find it.

3.2 OmniFlop driver

To be able to access Ensoniq formatted floppy disks you need to have a special
disk driver. If you do not plan using floppies, then you can leave out this
step.

First, get the latest version of the driver from here (be sure you get the
latest version, 2.01k minimum):
http://www.shlock.co.uk/Utils/OmniFlop/OmniFlop.htm

The driver package comes with detailed installation instructions. Be sure to
read them and follow them closely.

Now you're just one step far from being able to use the driver. You need to
a license to use it with EnsoniqFS. Don't be afraid - the license is free and
it is available via instant online registration. Here's how you get the
license:
	
From the OmniFlop package, start OmniFlop.exe. The "OmniFlop Wizard" opens.
Click "Next", choose "Get a license" and click "Next" again. Then a warning
appears that you normally do not need a license, but trust me - in this case
you do - so click "OK" and from the next dialog choose "TotalCommander 
EnsoniqFS plugin" and click "Finish". The registration dialog will open.
Click "Register on-line" and a browser window will be opened with the 
appropriate values already filled in. Enter your email address and submit
the form. A new license will be emailed to you instantly. Copy the license 
key you got via mail and paste it into the OmniFlop registration window.
Click OK and you are done!

3.3 ETools

Until a complete installer is ready, you can copy the ETools.exe to anywhere
you want. You can directly start and use it.

4 Using EnsoniqFS

4.1 EnsoniqFS

If you successfully mastered the installation, the plugin is available through
your network neighbourhood inside Total Commander. Hit Alt+F1 (or Alt+F2) or
click on the drive combo box and choose "network neighbourhood". The directory
listing should then contain "Ensoniq filesystems". If not, something is really
wrong (try to re-download and re-install the file).

If you then enter the "Ensoniq filesystems" folder, EnsoniqFS tries to detect
all your drives. This may take a few seconds (a progress dialog will be shown).
After that, you'll see three folders: "CDROMs", "Image files" and "Physical
disks".

4.1.1 CDROMs

If you insert an Ensoniq formatted CDROM into any of your CDROM drive or if you
use an appropriate image file together with a CDROM emulation driver, you will
see that CDROMs inside the CDROM folder. You can than browse them as usual.

4.1.2 Image files

Initially, the image folder is empty. To add a new image file, go to the other
tab of Total Commander and browse to an ISO image file you want to mount. Press
<F5> to copy it to the image file folder. It will be mounted and you can browse
it.

Removing image files from the list is a bit unconvenient at the moment (will
be improved soon): Navigate to your Windows installation folder and open the
file "fsplugin.ini". Open it and remove the image file you want to unmount
from the section "[EnsoniqFS]". Then re-mount all drives by going back to the
"Network neighbourhood/Ensoniq filesystems" folder.

4.1.3 Physical disks

In this folder, all harddisks, floppy disks and other removable media which
was found during the detection process will be shown. Enter the devices to
browse them.

4.2 ETools

ETools is a piece of software which can do the following things for you:
- completely backup an Ensoniq drive to an ISO file
- restore ISO file to drive
- format drive (at the moment, only QuickFormat is supported - this will be
  changed soon)
- check Ensoniq file systems for errors and fix these errors if possible
  (this function will also be improved in the next time)
  
To operate on a drive, first select it from the dropdown list on top of the
application. Then choose either to backup, restore, check or format this drive.
