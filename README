1 What is EnsoniqFS?
--------------------

EnsoniqFS is a file system plugin for the file manager Total Commander created
by Christian Ghisler (http://www.ghisler.com).

With EnsoniqFS you can mount the following Ensoniq file systems:
- SCSI & IDE harddisks
- SCSI & IDE removable disks (i. e. ZIP drives)
- SCSI & IDE CDROMs
- floppy disks (direct file access, using driver OmniFlop, see below)
- image files ISO, IMG, Mode1CDROM (BIN), GKH, EDE, EDA, EDT, EDV

Once mounted, on a file system you can do the following with Total Commander:
- read, write, copy, move, rename, delete files on Ensoniq media
- copy, move files from/to Windows drives
- create, rename, copy, move whole directories

CDROMs and BIN (Mode1 CDROM images)/GKH/EDE/EDA/EDT/EDV files are read only, 
writing is not supported (write support for the image files could be 
implemented in the future).

With the above, you get a complete file manager for Ensoniq disks.

2 Where to get it
-----------------

All the project related stuff is located at SourceForge:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ensoniqfs/

There you can download EnsoniqFS and related tools. If you're
interested, you can check out the source codes as well.

3 Installation
--------------

3.1 EnsoniqFS, ETools

To use EnsoniqFS, you first need to have Total Commander installed. Download
your copy from http://www.ghisler.com. Installation is straightforward, there
shouldn't be any problems. Be sure to get the latest version (6.5 minimum).

Then, run the installer for EnsoniqFS (which you should have downloaded from
SourceForge). Every file will be copied to its location, the INI file of
Total Commander will be modified. You will have to restart Total Commander 
after installation to gain access to the plugin.

3.2 OmniFlop driver

To be able to access Ensoniq formatted floppy disks you need to have a special
disk driver. If you do not plan using floppies, then you can leave out this
step. The EnsoniqFS plugin will also work without this driver (you're then
limited to the usage of image files and SCSI disks).

First, get the driver from here (be sure you get the latest version, 2.01k 
minimum):
http://www.shlock.co.uk/Utils/OmniFlop/OmniFlop.htm

The driver package comes with detailed installation instructions. Be sure to
read them and follow them closely.

Now you're just one step far from being able to use the driver. You need a
license to use it with EnsoniqFS. Don't be afraid - the license is free and
it is available via instant online registration. Here's how you get the
license:
	
From the OmniFlop package, start OmniFlop.exe. The "OmniFlop Wizard" opens.
Click "Next", choose "Get a license" and click "Next" again. Then a warning
appears that you normally do not need a license, but trust me - in this case
you do - so click "OK" and from the next dialog choose "TotalCommander 
EnsoniqFS plugin" and click "Finish". The registration dialog will open.
Click "Register on-line" and a browser window will be opened with the 
appropriate values already filled in. Enter your email address and submit
the form. A new license will be emailed to you instantly. Copy the license 
key you got via mail and paste it into the OmniFlop registration window.
Click OK and you are done!

4 Using EnsoniqFS

4.1 EnsoniqFS

If you successfully mastered the installation, the plugin is available through
your network neighbourhood inside Total Commander. Hit Alt+F1 (or Alt+F2) or
click on the drive combo box and choose "network neighbourhood". The directory
listing should then contain "Ensoniq filesystems". If not, something is really
wrong (try to re-download and re-install the file).

If you then enter the "Ensoniq filesystems" folder, EnsoniqFS tries to detect
all your drives. This may take a few seconds (a progress dialog will be shown).
After that, you'll see three folders: "CDROMs", "Image files" and "Physical
disks".

Along with that, you should see an entry "Options" and "Rescan devices" (see
below for an explanation).

4.1.1 CDROMs

If you insert an Ensoniq formatted CDROM into any of your CDROM drives or if
you use an appropriate image file together with a CDROM emulation driver, you
will see these CDROMs inside the CDROM folder. You can than browse them the
same way as you do with Windows files and folders.

4.1.2 Image files

Initially, the image folder is empty. To add a new image file, go to the other
tab of Total Commander and browse to an image file you want to mount. Press 
<F5> to copy it to the image file folder. It will be mounted and you can browse
it. Another way of adding (and removing) image files is through the "Options" 
dialog, see 4.1.4. The "Options" dialog also is the only method to unmount an
image file.

Note: Having many images mounted can be a real memory eater. For each image
file a cache and lots of other data structures are created. So be sure to
unmount unused image files.

4.1.3 Physical disks

In this folder, all harddisks, floppy disks and other removable media which
were found during the detection process will be shown. Enter this folder to
browse them.

4.1.4 Options

If you hit "Enter" on the "Options" entry (or if you double click it), an
options dialog is shown. Here you can modify EnsoniqFS's behaviour.

[ ] Enable floppy disk access
Activate this checkbox to allow EnsoniqFS to use your floppy disk drives.

[ ] Enable CDROM access
Activate this checkbox to allow EnsoniqFS to use your CDROM drives.

[ ] Enable removable/fixed disk access
Activate this checkbox to allow EnsoniqFS to use your SCSI and IDE harddisks 
and removable disks (e. g. ZIP drives should show up there). 

[ ] Enable image file support
Activate this checkbox to allow EnsoniqFS to use image files. EnsoniqFS
supports ISO (read/write) and BIN, GKH, EDE, EDA, EDT, EDV (read only).

If you uncheck any of the above options, EnsoniqFS doesn't scan the associated
drives or files. This can speed up the detection process.

[ ] Re-scan device list everytime the \\\Ensoniq filesystems folder is entered
Normally, EnsoniqFS updates the device list every time you enter the "Root"
directory of EnsoniqFS. This causes a delay, a progress dialog will be shown.
If you do not want EnsoniqFS to rescan that often, you should disable this
checkbox. You can update the device list manually (see below).

Mounting/unmounting image files

If you select an image file from the dropdown box at the bottom of the options
dialog, you can click on the "Unmount selected image" button to remove that
image file from the list. With "Mount new image..." you can mount new image
files.

4.1.5 Rescan devices

In case you disabled the automatic device detection, you can issue a new
detection by hitting "Enter" on "Rescan devices" (or by double clicking it).
EnsoniqFS will then scan all available devices for EnsoniqMedia.

You should do this if either your configuration changed (maybe you plugged in
another SCSI disk or ZIP drive) or if you inserted new removable media into
one of your devices.

4.2 ETools

ETools is a piece of software which can do the following things for you:
- completely backup an Ensoniq drive to an ISO file
- restore ISO file to drive
- format drive (at the moment, only QuickFormat is supported - this will be
  changed soon)
- check Ensoniq file systems for errors and fix these errors if possible
  (this function will also be improved in the next time)
  
To operate on a drive, first select it from the dropdown list on top of the
application. Then choose either to backup, restore, check or format this drive.

For backup, at the moment two methods are supported: Full backup and partition
backup (the third option, file backup, is not implemented yet). If you choose
partition backup, only the space which is allocated by the Ensoniq file system
will be written to an ISO file. This could be useful if you formatted a big
drive to a lower capacity and don't want to have a huge full drive backup.

5 Bugs
